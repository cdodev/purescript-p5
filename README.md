# purescript-p5

p5.js bindings for PureScript

*This project has just been started and so far only implements a handful of functions in the p5.js API*

I'm currently trying to generate the FFI from the p5.js YUIDoc.

Completed:
  * yuidoc parsing
  * generating FFI PureScript functions for basic p5.js types

TODO:
  * generate FFI for more complicated p5.js types (e.g. p5.Color, p5.Vector)
  * generate function wrappers in foreign JavaScript module
  * use foreign function types instead of curried functions
  * exclude private methods from FFI
  * give unique names to functions that have multiple definitions
  * handle optional parameters
  * generate comments for FFI functions so that purescript-p5 documentation can be auto-generated by pulp
