# purescript-p5

p5.js bindings for PureScript

*Disclaimer: This project has just been started and the API is still very unstable.*

* [Module documentation](generated-docs/)
* [List of not-yet-implemented p5.js methods](unsupported.md)


I'm currently in the process of generating the FFI from the p5.js YUIDoc.

Completed:
  * parse p5.js YUIDoc
  * generate FFI PureScript functions for basic p5.js types

TODO:
  * generate FFI for more complicated p5.js types (e.g. p5.Color, p5.Vector)
  * support functions with greater than 10 arguments
  * generate comments for FFI functions so that purescript-p5 documentation can be auto-generated by pulp
  * move Main.purs into examples directory
